               *** CALL FOR PAPERS ***

ARCADE                    http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~regerg/arcade/
Automated Reasoning:
Challenges, Applications, Directions, Exemplary achievements

6 August 2017, Gothenburg, Sweden (co-located with CADE-26)

## DESCRIPTION:

The main goal of this workshop is to bring together key people
from various subcommunities of automated reasoning---such as
SAT/SMT, resolution, tableaux, theory-specific calculi (e.g. for
description logic, arithmetic, set theory), interactive theorem
proving---to discuss the present, past, and future of the field.
The intention is to provide an opportunity to discuss broad
issues facing the community.

The structure of the workshop will be informal. We invite
extended abstracts (2-4 pages, using the EasyChair class style
http://www.easychair.org/publications/for_authors) in the form
of non-technical position statements aimed at prompting lively
discussion. The title of the workshop is indicative of the kind
of discussions we would like to encourage:

Challenges: What are the next grand challenges for research on
automated reasoning? Thereby, we refer to problems, solving
which would imply a significant impact (e.g., shift of focus) on
the CADE community and beyond. Roughly ten years ago SMT was one
such challenge.

Applications: Is automated reasoning applicable in real-world
(industrial) scenarios. Should reports on such applications be
encouraged at a venue like CADE, perhaps by means of a special
case study paper category?

Directions: Based on the grand challenges and requirements from
real-world applications, what are the research directions the
community should promote? What bridges between the different
subcommunities of automated reasoning need to be strengthened?
What new communities should be included (if at all)? For
example, following Reiner Hähnle's question in the AAR
Newsletter, is there a place at CADE for research on usable
automated reasoning (in resemblance to the flourishing topic of
usable security)?

Exemplary achievements: What are the landmark achievements of
automated reasoning whose influence reached far beyond the CADE
community itself? What can we learn from those successes when
shaping our future research?

Contributions will be grouped into similar themes and authors
will be invited to make their case within discussion panels.
Authors will then be invited to extend their abstracts (e.g., by
transcripts of the discussion and a summary of the discussion's
outcomes) for inclusion in an EPiC post-proceedings.
