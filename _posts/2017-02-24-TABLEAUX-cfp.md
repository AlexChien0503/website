## GENERAL INFORMATION

   TABLEAUX is the main international conference at which research
   on all aspects, theoretical foundations, implementation techniques,
   systems development and applications, of the mechanization of
   tableau-based reasoning and related methods is presented. As
   the first TABLEAUX workshop was held in Lautenbach in 1992, this
   year's conference will include special events celebrating 25 years
   of TABLEAUX.

   The conference will be held in Brasília from 25-28 September 2017.
   It will be co-located with both the 11th International Symposium
   on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2017) and the 8th
   International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP
   2017).

## TOPICS
   Tableau methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools for
   automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical
   logic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For large groups
   of logics, tableau methods can be generated automatically. Areas
   of application include verification of software and computer
   systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its
   required inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.

   Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

     * tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics
       (including first-order, higher-order, modal, temporal,
       description, hybrid, intuitionistic, substructural,
       relevance, non-monotonic logics) and their proof-theoretic
       foundations;

     * related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking,
       connection methods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);

     * sequent calculi and natural deduction calculi for classical
       and non-classical logics, as tools for proof search and proof
       representation;

     * flexible, easily extendable, light weight methods for theorem
       proving;

     * novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification
       in classical and non-classical logics;

     * systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations and
       applications (provers, logical frameworks, model checkers, ...);

     * implementation techniques (data structures, efficient
       algorithms, performance measurement, extensibility, ...);

     * extensions of tableau procedures with conflict-driven
       learning, generation of proofs; compact (or humanly readable)
       representation of proofs;

     * decision procedures, theoretically optimal procedures;

     * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software
       development, verification, deductive and temporal
       databases, knowledge representation, ontologies, fault
       diagnosis or teaching.

   We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau
   procedures to real world examples.

   Such papers should be tailored to the tableau community and should focus on the role of
   reasoning, and logical aspects of the solution.

## CELEBRATING 25 YEARS

   website.

# PUBLICATION DETAILS

   The conference proceedings will published in the Springer
   LNAI/LNCS series, as in previous editions.

# SUBMISSIONS
   Submissions are invited in two categories:

     A  Research papers, which describe original theoretical
        research, original algorithms, or applications, with length
        up to 15 pages.
     B  System descriptions, with length up to 9 pages.

   Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly with the help of
   external reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance
   and originality.

   For category A, theoretical results and algorithms must be
   original, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions
   will be reviewed taking into account correctness, theoretical
   elegance, and possible implementability.

   For category B submissions, a working implementation must be
   accessible via the internet, which includes sources. The aim of a
   system description is to make the system available in such a way
   that users can use it, understand it, and build on it.

   Accepted papers in both categories will be published in the
   conference proceedings. Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the
   llncs style and must be submitted electronically as PDF files via
   the EasyChair system:

   (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tableaux2017)[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tableaux2017]

   For all accepted papers at least one author is required to attend
   the conference and present the paper. A paper title and a short
   abstract of about 100 words must be submitted before the paper
   submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions
   will be made available at the conference website. Be aware that
   neither plagiarism, nor self-plagiarism, nor duplicate publication
   is acceptable. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files
   can be obtained via

http://www.springer.com/br/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

#BEST PAPER AWARD

   The TABLEAUX 2017 Best Paper Award will be presented to the best
   submission nominated and chosen by the Program Committee among
   the accepted papers. The eligibility criteria will place emphasis
   on the originality and significance of the contribution, but
   readability and the overall technical quality, including correctness
   and completeness of results, will also be considered. The TABLEAUX
   Best Paper Award was established in 2015 and is a permanent
   initiative of TABLEAUX.
