               =================================================
                              CALL FOR PAPERS
                        Journal of Automated Reasoning

                               Special Issue On
                         Automated Reasoning Systems
               =================================================

The past few decades have seen major developments and practical achievements in
 automated reasoning systems. For example, SAT solving has become an inherent
part of the standard hardware production process; SMT solvers are now the
backbone of most software verification techniques; first-order theorem provers
have pushed the productivity of interactive theorem proving to a new level;
computer algebra systems have solved difficult problems in mathematics and
biology; knowledge representation systems have become indispensable for
reasoning in the world wide web; automatic termination checkers routinely prove
the termination of complex programs.

This special issue is dedicated to automated reasoning systems in their full
variety along the following dimensions:

1) considered logic: propositional (including (D)QBF), first-order modulo
   theories, modal, temporal, decidable fragments of larger logics, FOL, and
   HOL, ...;

2) considered problem: satisfiability, interpolation, quantifier elimination,
   consequence finding, model building, reachability, termination, ...;

3) application area: formal methods, artificial intelligence, mathematics,
   biology, product development, security, ...;

4) user base: academic, educational, or industrial.

In particular, we welcome papers emphasizing engineering aspects because, while
often crucial for the success of automated reasoning tools, they are typically
not given a sufficiently detailed treatment in theory papers or system
description papers published at conferences or workshops.

We welcome full-length papers describing past work not previously published in
a journal as well as papers of any length describing new developments. Revised
and enhanced versions of papers published in conference proceedings that have
not appeared in archival journals are also eligible for submission. All
submissions will be reviewed according to the usual standards of scholarship
and originality.

We encourage submissions that include most, if not all, of the following:

(i) theory details

(ii) implementation details

(iii) applications, and

(iv) experiments.

Papers should be in PDF format, following the JAR guidelines for authors,
http://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/journal/10817
and be submitted using EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jars2017

To encourage a speedy review cycle, we will expect authors of submissions to
serve as referees for other submissions as needed.
