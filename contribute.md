## The human way

Just send your information to [daniel@satlive.org](mailto:daniel@satlive.org)

## The hacker way

The new SAT Live! is built using [Jeckyll](http://jekyllrb.com). All the posts are written using a specific markdown format which is then transformed into HTML. All the content of the website is stored on a git repository.

The proper way to submit a new "post" to SAT Live! is thus to:

* [clone](https://github.com/satlive/website/fork) the current SAT Live! web site on github
* write your own post: make sure to [properly adhere the naming conventions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
* send me a pull request :)

Regular contributors will get write access to the git repository to facilitate the integration of their information.
